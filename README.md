# Bandwidth Problem
The bandwidth problem is numbering the vertices of a given graph G
such that the maximum diference between the numbers of adjacent vertices is minimal. This is known to be NP-complete and only few special cases of this problem are known to be efficient. 
This program uses backtracking to solve this problem.

## Data
Each text file has information about graph. </br>
The first number is number of vertices and second number is number of edges. </br>
Last part shows the numbers of vertices that are adjacent.
